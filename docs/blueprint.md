## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep red (#800000), evoking the rich, warm tones of the holiday season.
- Background color: Soft, desaturated beige (#F5F5DC), providing a clean and elegant backdrop.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFD700) for highlighting key elements such as prices and call-to-action buttons, suggesting luxury and quality.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' serif for an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif as it works very well in conjunction with Playfair, offering high legibility for the longer texts in the body. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use elegant and festive icons related to Christmas and baking, such as snowflakes, gifts, and whisks, to enhance the holiday theme.
- Subtle animations, such as a gentle fade-in effect on sections as the user scrolls, will add a premium feel to the page.
- Ensure sections are clearly divided and spaced to enhance readability and guide the user through the sales narrative. Employ cards with rounded corners and soft shadows to present information in a visually appealing manner.
